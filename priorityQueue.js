// WHAT IS A PRIORITY QUEUE?

// A data structure where each element has a priority.
// Elements with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities.

// OUR PRIORITY QUEUE

// Write a Min Binary Heap - lower number means higher priority.
// Each Node has a val and a priority.  Use the priority to build the heap.
// Enqueue method accepts a value and priority, makes a new node, and puts it in the right spot based off of its priority.
// Dequeue method removes root element, returns it, and rearranges heap using priority
